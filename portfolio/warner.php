            <h2 class="portfolio-h2">html &amp; css</h2>
            <p>While migrating content to new pages, I coded HTML in the widgets. While doing this, I eliminated deprecated tags and updated the code to conform to current norms.</p>
    
            <h2 class="portfolio-h2">php</h2>
            <p>During the course of this internship, I coded a function to create a working <a href="https://www.warner.rochester.edu/sitemap" target="_parent">search bar for the site map</a>. I first thought about the task in terms of how computers understand the problem and decided how to code it. After writing the PHP, I tested and refined my solution. I expanded it for longer search terms and fixed design problems (like confusing indentation) in the results list.</p>
    
            <p>I tested the search function across all browsers and platforms. I encountered bugs in some browsers, particularly on the mobile site.</p>
    
            <h3>Troubleshooting Process:</h3>
            <ol>
              <li>Carefully check code for mistakes.</li>
              <li>Ask the internet (Google is your friend).</li>
              <li>Edit code &amp; test it.</li>
              <li>If unsuccessful, repeat steps 1-3.</li>
              <li>If I still can't get it after a few tries, I consult my supervisor.</li>
            </ol>
    
            <h2 class="portfolio-h2">user experience design</h2>
            <p>I improved the UX by putting myself in the user's place and coding the front-end so that it would behave as expected. For example, there is a page with an outline of the faculty/staff handbook. There was no distinction between links that:</p>
            <ol>
              <li>Open a new page</li>
              <li>Download a PDF or other file</li>
            </ol>
    
            <p>To eliminate the possibility of surprise downloads, I needed to ask myself, "How do I make it obvious that a list item will start a download?" After considering a variety of options and checking other sites to see how they behave in this situation, I removed the hyperlink from each list item and added a clear "download" link in parentheses at the end of the line.</p>
    
            <h2 class="portfolio-h2">design</h2>
            <p>While migrating content from old pages to new ones as we revamped the site, I applied several main design principles (repetition, hierarchy, space, and rhythm, to name a few). Using fonts and colors already on the website, I cleaned up the overall visual impression of each page, shortened and clarified content, and made sure layout was consistent across the site.</p>
            <p>Everyone else on my team specialized in back-end coding, so my supervisor assigned all design work and CSS coding to me. When once he asked me to create a new button design, I made 4 different options using CSS classes. I utilized colors already present in the site's color scheme in order to seamlessly integrate the buttons, and I added gradient with other blues and yellows in the site's design.</p>
