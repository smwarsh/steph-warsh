			<h3>Day 60 Check-In</h3>

			<p>What do I think about 100 Days of Code so far? Frankly, I love it. It has definitely been hard. For instance, right now I’d really rather just go to sleep. It’s been a long week and I’m looking forward to just going to bed, but I have an hour ahead of me and I promised myself I would write a blog post. I had planned to write one every 30 days and I did not, but Google likes a website that’s been updated, so I should check in.</p>

			<h3>My Progress So Far</h3>

			<p>I have been focusing on learning JavaScript, and I started out by going through <a href="https://www.freecodecamp.org/" target="_blank">FreeCodeCamp</a> challenges (which was not very stimulating). Then, someone on Twitter, <a href="https://twitter.com/vanessacnaja" target="_blank">Vanessa</a>, recommended the <a href="https://watchandcode.com/" target="_blank">Practical Javascript</a> course to me (which felt more useful). While working on that course, I started my project.</p>

			<p><strong>I’m writing an <a href="https://codesandbox.io/s/93m01wq3qo" target="_blank">expense tracker app</a></strong>, which I’ve named Thrift. I track my spending in my daily life, so I’m excited about making a web application for this. The project will help me learn JavaScript in a more concentrated, interesting way.</p>

			<p>I am really glad I’m working on a project, because it will be great to add it to my portfolio and showcase it for people to see. Everyone I talk to says projects are the best way to learn, and that makes me feel really good about my project. I definitely have the most fun when I am working on my project; those days go by the fastest.</p>

			<h3>Challenges</h3>

			<p>I initially set up Thrift to be similar to Gordon Zhu’s to do list project, but it didn’t work out at all. While I was dealing with that block, <a href="https://twitter.com/cjaredm" target="_blank">Jared</a>, a developer, reached out to me through Twitter. He invited me to a JavaScript meet up and has been really helpful whenever I get stuck on my project.</p>

			<p>I quickly realized, upon starting my 100 days of code, that there is not a single person in my life who knows JavaScript. I have no one to talk to about what I’m doing. So it’s nice to attend the meet ups that Jared occasionally hosts, and it is a relief to have a real person I can go to for help. It has been hard to adjust to not having a TA or professor to look to, or even just classmates to discuss my code with.</p>

			<p>It is hard to find the time to code every day, what with working a full time job, maintaining a fulfilling long distance relationship, going to what feels like constant doctors appointments, and exercising regularly. Almost every day I have to sacrifice sleep or my lunch break to fit in the hour.</p>

			<p>I tend to compare myself to people out there who code for three hours a day. I have to constantly remind myself that I’m doing the very best I can, and I need to be fair to myself. I don’t even know what others’ situations are like, and it’s not worth comparing myself to them and getting down about it.</p>

			<p>Although <a href="https://twitter.com/smwarsh" target="_blank">I post my progress on Twitter every day</a>, and I comment on two tweets daily to encourage people in their 100 days progress, I haven’t been very active on Twitter beyond that. I had intended to read articles, connect with people, and more, but that takes up a lot of time I don’t have. My life doesn’t usually feature much free time, so I don’t think I can make a commitment to all that extra engagement on Twitter. I can only focus on so many things at once.</p>

			<p>I try to stick to only two “projects” at a time, which is often difficult. My mind naturally tends to jump around and follow different ideas, so this rule has been helpful to keep in mind. I follow one tutorial through to completion before starting another one, while concurrently working on Thrift. Two things at a time.</p>

			<h3>Concerns Revisited</h3>

			<p>Going into this challenge, I was concerned about how to keep coding when attending work conferences. I have a conference in early November, and that will be tough, but I am going to do my best. Also, I have had a couple of friends visit me during these first sixty days. They have been very willing to let me code, and we usually just have a quiet hour where we both work on things. So far, so good with all of this.</p>

			<p>I was also concerned about the rule that time spent doing tutorials, online courses, and other similar resources should not count towards the challenge, and that only work on real code and projects count. I have been counting the tutorials and such resources, and I think that is the way it has to be. I mean, I am moving forward every day. I might not be moving forward as quickly as someone who codes on a project every day, but, for example, there’s no way I would have gotten through that four-and-a-half hour SQL tutorial if it didn’t count towards my hour of code. I don’t have very much time. I’m just going to keep it up like this. I’ll start the clock and work on whatever it is I’ve decided to work on, for an hour or as long as I can.</p>

			<h3>Conclusion</h3>

			<p>I have been able to stick to almost all of the rules I set for myself at Day 1. There have only been two days where I have been unable to finish my hour of code. I don’t count them as full days, but I don’t necessarily count them as skip days either. I’ve taken four days off, which is the allotted amount. I’m proud of how well I’ve been doing, even on Wednesdays when I have to wake up super early to code because I won’t be home until very late. I’m proud of myself for keeping up with it.</p>

			<p>It’s crazy, I’ve been doing this for two months now, but I have just gotten so far. I never thought I’d be this far in my project, and I’m thrilled.</p>

			<p>I hope to keep coding every day, even after 100 days have passed. I mean, I’ll probably take a nice break of about a week after the 100 days are over, but then I want to get right back to it, because it is really fun.</p>

			<h2>Day 1 of 100 Days of Code</h2>

			<p class="author">Steph Warsh</p>

			<div class="time-stamp">
				<p>Friday August 10, 2018</p>
				<p>9:43pm EST</p>
			</div>
			<h3>Background</h3>

			<p>For over a year, I have been telling myself that I’m going to do three projects in particular, and I have not done them:</p>

			<ol>
				<li><strong>Make <a href="https://www.stephwarsh.com/" target="_blank">my website</a> better.</strong> Improve the content, make the design and code more sophisticated.</li>
				<li><strong>Expand <a href="https://www.stephwarsh.com/portfolio.php" target="_blank">my portfolio</a>.</strong> A couple of friends have expressed interest in having me make websites for them, and this is a great opportunity and something I’ve been <em>saying</em> I’ll capitalize on, but have not.</li>
				<li><strong>Learn JavaScript.</strong> My school, University of Rochester, didn’t have any classes on JavaScript, so although I’m pretty proficient in HTML and CSS, I need Javascript if I want to get a career in web dev. I’ve known this since an interview for a front end web developer position in May 2017 (15 months ago!). That was the moment I realized, “These companies want someone who knows JavaScript. I need to learn JavaScript if I’m going to get a job in this industry.”</li>
			</ol>

			<p>Like the creator of #100DaysOfCode, <a href="https://twitter.com/ka11away" target="_blank">Alexander Kallaway</a>, points out, the hardest part is just sitting down and doing it.</p>

			<h3>Goals</h3>

			<p>I am asking myself, What is the <em>point</em> of doing 100 Days of Code? Throughout the challenge, I want to be able to remember why I started. <strong>Overall, my mission is to make myself a better candidate for a job in web development.</strong></p>

			<p>I applied to probably forty jobs in web design and related job titles before leaving college and didn’t get any of them. I am not qualified (yet) for a job as a web developer or UX/UI designer or whatever it is I want to be.</p>

			<p>One of the things I want to do for the next 100 days is to maintain a presence in the design community on Twitter. It will be helpful for me to read articles and conversations and immerse myself in the current events of design, and that will also help me be a more competitive candidate when I do start looking for jobs.</p>

			<p>Daily:</p>

			<ul>
				<li>1-5 relevant tweets</li>
				<li>Find and like 5 new accounts</li>
				<li>Retweet 3 new pieces of content</li>
				<li>Experiment with 1 trending hashtag</li>
			</ul>

			<p>I also want to find out whether I’m more interested in UX/UI design or whether I’m more interested in the coding aspect and becoming a front end web developer. My friend Zoe pointed out to me that the label isn’t as important as being confident in knowing my interests, so this is a secondary goal for #100DaysOfCode, like the goal to stay active on Twitter.</p>

			<h3>Project – Learn JavaScript</h3>

			<p>Learning JavaScript will help me succeed in my other goals, so I will start there.</p>

			<p>Alexander Kallaway suggests that if you don’t know the language yet and can’t work on projects, get as far as you can in 100 days in the FreeCodeCamp Front End Curriculum. A front-end web developer I spoke to recommended the same thing.</p>

			<p>Based on these suggestions, this is my plan of attack:</p>

			<ol>
				<li>Start with HTML/CSS</li>
				<li>If that’s too easy, do all the projects for HTML/CSS</li>
				<li>Then, move on the the JavaScript curriculum</li>
			</ol>

			<h3>Rules</h3>

			<ol>
				<li>Code for minimum one hour a day</li>
				<li>Tweet about my progress every day <a href="https://twitter.com/smwarsh" target="_blank">@smwarsh</a> using the hashtag <a href="https://twitter.com/hashtag/100DaysOfCode?src=hash" target="_blank">#100DaysOfCode</a></li>
				<li>Each day, reach out to at least two people on Twitter who are also doing the challenge</li>
				<li>Log daily on GitHub</li>
				<li>Write a blog post at Day 1, Day 30, Day 60, Day 90, and Day 100 to see how well I’m following the rules, what kinds of adjustments I need to make, etc.</li>
				<li>Push code to GitHub every day (when relevant) so that anyone can see my progress. If you want, you can follow me <a href="https://github.com/smwarsh" title="smwarsh on GitHub" target="_blank">here</a>.</li>
			</ol>

			<p>I am worried I won’t have time to code every single day, specifically at work conferences, where I get only a couple hours of sleep every night. Realistically, I don’t know if I will manage to code on those days.</p>

			<p>I don’t know what to do when I am traveling, but I don’t want to cheat on those days. I don't want to skip them.</p>

			<p>Zoe suggested that I could do those hours beforehand. For example, if I know I’m going to be away all week at a work conference, I could spend the whole weekend before the trip coding, doing those hours. This would be similar to how I used to treat college assignments when I went away for sports or other trips. I know you’re not supposed to skip two days in a row, but I’m trying to think realistically in terms of my lifestyle. As a compromise, even if I do the extra work ahead of time, I should add the skipped days onto the end of the challenge.</p>

			<p>I will try to code even while I’m on vacation. Hopefully the friends I’m visiting will understand if I ask for an hour of time to code each day. Or maybe it will end up happening something like I just described for the work conferences.</p>

			<p>Another rule that worries me, from Alexander Kallaway’s <a href="https://medium.freecodecamp.org/join-the-100daysofcode-556ddb4579e4" target="_blank">blog post</a>: “The time spent doing tutorials, online courses, and other similar resources will NOT count towards this challenge. I want to write real code and work on real projects, facing real challenges.”</p>

			<p>I don’t think I can commit at this level. For the first thirty days I will start the clock and work on the FreeCodeCamp curriculum or other tasks related to my goals. It is a small step, but that is what I need to get started. It will be <em>more</em> than what I have been doing and I will be doing something for eventually changing my career to web design. After thirty days I will reevaluate this rule. Perhaps if I have enough coding knowledge to do projects, I will start to follow it more strictly.</p>

			<h3>Conclusion</h3>

			<p>These are my thoughts on the rules so far, my interpretation of them, and my game plan for #100DaysOfCode. I really want to make it work, because I keep saying that I want to change my career to web design, but I’m not doing anything about it. That needs to change. I know this will make me happy in the long run, so I need to do it, even if it is hard in the short term.</p>
